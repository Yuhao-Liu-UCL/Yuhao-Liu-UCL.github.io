                  gradually decreased. In addition, the number of net immigrants in London city has also

      <div class="explanation_right">
        <p class="exp_title">Are you curious about population compositions in London?</p>
        <p class="exp_txt">We can clearly see that the population density of outer London has not increased as
          significant as the inner London, also most of the flow of people has gathered into inner London. The density
          of Camden and Southwark has increased the most in the past decade.

          London is dominated by adults. Elder people are mostly based in outer London, except for two boroughs with
          highest incomes (City of London, Kensington and Chelsea). Children under 18 are quite evenly distributed in
          the city.

          London is the city which mainly occupied by white races. The white races in the west of London are more
          densely distributed, and further to east London you can see the distribution of the various races is getting
          more and more even.

          So, Do You Have A Basic Understanding of London Now?
